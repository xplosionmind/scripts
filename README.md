A collection of self-made scripts to carry out nicely some very specific tasks.

* `[boom]`: build and deploy <https://tommi.space> and <gemini://tommi.space>
* `[titan]`: a subscript of `[boom]` aimed specifically at building and deploying <gemini://tommi.space>
* `[bang]`: local command to invoke `[boom]` via SSH

[boom]: boom 'the script that builds and deploys tommi.space'
[titan]: titan 'the script that builds and deploys tommi.space on Gemini'
[bang]: bang 'local script to invoke bang via SSH'
